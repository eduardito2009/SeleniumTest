Anytime we see an attribute has a numeric value inside the id is not reliable most likely will change in the future
CSS selector:
what CSS stands for (Cascading style sheet)

It is another way of locating elements on the web page

Syntax:
 tagname[attributes = 'attributes value']
 Example: button[type = 'submit']

 Css does not give an opportunity to locate the element by its text

 Shortcuts for CSS:
 Shortcut for Classname --> "."

 Syntax: tagname.classNameValue
         input.button

  Shortcut for ID --> "#"
  Syntax: tagname#IDValue
          Example: input#twotabsearchtextbox

  contains() method in css:
  * symbol represents contains method
  tagname[attributes *= 'attributes value']
  Example: input[placeholder *= 'phone']

  starts-with method in css:
  ^(Circumflex) symbol represents starts with method
  tagname[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']
  Example: input[type^='pass']

 ends-with method in css:
 $ symbol represents ends-with method in css
 tagname[attribute $= 'ending attributte value']
 Example:img[src $= 'syntax.png']

 Difference between CSS and XPath

--> CSS cannot locate elements by text whereas xpath can
--> no ends-with method in Xpath
--> CSS is faster than xpath(finding elements)
-->CSS has shortcuts
-->no advance CSS
-->CSS has more simple syntax thanXpath

WebElement Commands:

isDisplayed()--> boolean value
isSelected() --> boolean value
