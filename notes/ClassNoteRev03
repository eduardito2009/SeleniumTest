Alerts:
    1. Web Based Alerts -- html -- can be dealt using selenium.
    2. JavaScript Alerts --
    3. Windows Based Alerts --

Frames:
    You need to switch to the frame in order to deal with the desired element
    For switching, you use driver.switchTo.frame();
        1. By the index number of the frame
        2. By the name or id
        3. By accessing the frame as a WebElement

<html>
    <body>

    </body>

</html>

click on the box that resides inside another frame

Explicit wait
 WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver,20);

 Why the timeout is important?
  Use implicit wait when the element is not even in the dom/ needs to appear

  and use explicit wait if the element has certain condition associated with it like visibility,click ability etc
