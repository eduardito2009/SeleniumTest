Handle check Boxes or radio buttons: we can just click on them
Class 6
Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message.Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on

We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 Types of Alerts:
1) web based alerts/html alert we can simply inspect and perform need actions
2) Javascript alerts/browser alerts-we can handle these alerts by using switch to method
                                    we cannot inspect Java Script alerts

3) Windows based alerts-->we cannot handle with Selenium

Types of JS alerts
  1) Simple alert--> Only click ok
  2) Confirmation alert-->either cancel or click ok
  3) Prompt alert-->enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle Javascript alert we only have 4 methods:
  1.- accept ()--> click ok
  2.- dismiss()--> click cancel
  3.- getText()--> always get text by using this method
  4.- sendKeys()-->

To handled authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
"http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth"
//username:password@

Frames:
Frame is a separate and independent window in our webpage
Frame allow developers to represent multiple views in one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
   1)by index
   2)by name or id
   3)by WebElement

In alerts--> we switch to alert and switch automatically back
In Frames--> we switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

Interview question:
How do you handle alerts in Selenium?
We handle Alerts by using Alert interface
