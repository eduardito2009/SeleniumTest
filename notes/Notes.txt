HTML:Is a language that has a particular structure, and we can design the front end of any application
use W3school for HTML
<2>,<1> these are tags and each tag has they on
 purpose of <div is to divide the page in different sections

 Locators: to locate the elements and everything on the webpage is an element,why do we need to have access to elements
 and perform actions we find elements using different locators

 Xpath:


 <html>
 <body>
                     <h1>hello<h1>
                     <h1>
                         <p1>well though<p1>

                     <h1>
                     <h1>hiwert<h1>
                     <h1>hiwerrt<h1>
                     <h1>hiwetwet<h1>

 <body>
 <html>

 /html/body/h1[]/p1


 /html/body/h1[]




 /html/body/h1

 /html/body/div[2]/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/form/div[2]/div[2]/input absolute Xpath Example

 Relative xpath:

 we can use start with
 in the xpath
 //tagname[start-with(@attribute="starting of the attribute value")]
 //input[start-with(@id,"user")]
 Example
 <input id="imageno.1"/>
 //input[start-with(@id,"imageno")]

 contains:

 //tagname[contains(@id,'some portion of value')];
 Example:
 <input id+"imageno.1"/>
 //input[contains(@id,"imageno")]

 hey dom
 bring us the tag "input" -->//input
 who has an attribute id  -->[@id]
 and its value is userName -->[@id= 'username']

 by text:
  //tagName[text(


  CSS selector:
  tagname[attribute= "attribute value"]

  shortcuts:
  id = #
  <input @id= "rotwiller"/>
  input#rotwiller

  class = .

  <input @id= "rotwiller" @class="bigdogs"/>
  input.bigdogs
