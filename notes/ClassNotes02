What is a WebElement?
Is anything we see on a webpage is considered to be a WebElement
examples:
e.g, text, button, checkboxes, links

Selenium needs to know exactly where to go.
HTML?
Hyper Text mark up language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's internal view of the webpage
Also called as developer's tool's or Dev tool's
Document--> can be stored any document such as a pdf, excel...
Object--> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model--> it is just a layout of the HTML
Locator
Is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
is used to locate or identify webelements on the web page

8 Locators:
1) Id locator
2)Name
3) TagName
4)XPath
5) LinkText
6) PartialLinkText
7) CSS Selector
8) Classname
HTML Scripting Meaning:
purple --> tags || button, input, div
brown--> attribute || name, class, id
blue--> attribute values || any value that developers put on
Always check if it has id because that is unique

Why do we need many locators?
- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
- Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-Some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for e.g. linkText and partial LinkText
are only used for links

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

research about XPath for next week

If 2 or more elements have same attributes and attributes values, selenium will only interact with the first
element it locates
