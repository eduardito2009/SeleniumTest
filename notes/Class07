Selenium Class 7
Handling Multiple Windows (tabs):
 IN order to handle multiple windows we will be using:

 getWindowHandle()
 getWindowHandles()

 WindowHandle:
 Is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
 It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

 Synchronization:
 Is the process of bringing the speed of two or more components to the same level
 in this case we are bringing out script and page load to the same speed level

 Thread.sleep()--> static wait or unconditional wait

 Types of Selenium waits:
   1) Implicit wait: It tells the webdriver to wait for certain amount of time before throwing an exception
      it will be only written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
      We can say that Implicit wait is a global wait.
      Implicit wait works with findElement() method
      Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds. If your elements ia found in any time between the given time
      the remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or action

      If the element is not found in a given time, ONLY then you will get an exception
   2) Explicit wait
   3) Fluent wait
